`omp-claude-bridge` lets you drive **Claude Code** — Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, and Fable — from inside Oh My Pi, with every tool call flowing through OMP's native TUI. It also exposes an **AskClaude** tool so any other provider can delegate a task or a second opinion to Claude Code, and it registers each model with the **canonical context window** OMP's catalogue reports for it, so OMP's status bar, context-usage math, and model-switch safety stay accurate.

Authentication and billing run through Claude Code and your Anthropic subscription via the official [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript) — this extension never stores credentials.

## Features

- **Claude Code as a provider** — pick Opus / Sonnet / Haiku / Fable from `/model`; tool calls render in OMP's TUI like any native provider.
- **AskClaude delegation tool** — from any other provider, hand a task or question to Claude Code (read-only, no-tools, or full read/write/bash), optionally in an isolated session.
- **Accurate per-model context windows** — each model is registered with its canonical context capacity straight from OMP's Anthropic catalogue (e.g. Opus 5 and Sonnet 5 at 1M, Haiku 4.5 at 200K), so OMP never under- or over-reports a model's real limit.
- **Session resume & persistence** — conversations survive across turns and reconnects.
- **Faithful system-prompt transport** — Claude Code keeps its native `claude_code` preset; the bridge projects OMP's *portable* additions (context files, skills, custom/append text, and a subagent's role/assignment context including native `task.context`) behind it, without duplicating OMP's harness. Unaccountable prompts fail closed rather than silently dropping instructions.
- **Thinking support** — effort levels map through to Claude Code, including `xhigh` on Sonnet models.
- **MCP tool bridging** with strict-config isolation by default.

## Install

```bash
omp plugin install git:github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

```bash
# From the full HTTPS URL
omp plugin install https://github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge

# From a local checkout (great for hacking on it)
git clone https://github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge.git
omp plugin install ./omp-claude-bridge
```

</details>

Requires Oh My Pi (`omp`) and a working Claude Code login.

## Quickstart

1. Install the plugin (above).
2. In OMP, run `/model` and choose a `claude-bridge/*` model — for example `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5`.
3. Work as usual. Tool calls run through OMP's TUI; Claude Code handles the model turn.

To delegate from another provider instead, just ask: *"Ask Claude to review this plan and poke holes in it."*

## Context windows

Every Claude model has one canonical context window, and the bridge registers it straight from **OMP's Anthropic model catalogue** — the same metadata OMP uses everywhere else. There is no exact-id override table, no synthetic `-1m` / `-200k` picker variants, and no `[1m]` model-id spelling: the canonical model id is sent to Claude Code unchanged, and the registered `contextWindow` is the catalogue's value verbatim.

With the current catalogue that means, for example:

| Picker id | Registered window | Source |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-5` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-7` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-6` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5-1` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1M | OMP catalogue |
| `claude-bridge/claude-haiku-4-5` | 200K | OMP catalogue |

Because the window is data-driven, a newer revision of a supported family (say a future Opus 5.1 or Fable 5.2) is registered with its own catalogue window automatically after restart — no bridge source edit required.

### Runtime capability metadata

The Claude Agent SDK exposes **no pre-flight context-window capability API**: `query.supportedModels()` returns display/effort metadata but no context window, and the only 1M switch it documents (the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta) applies to Sonnet 4/4.5 — models that predate every family the bridge supports. Registration therefore uses the current OMP catalogue / Anthropic capability metadata as the source of truth, with no runtime-measured exact-id exceptions currently required.

> The window Claude Code actually *serves* is still logged from each result's `modelUsage` for observability. If a subscription ever serves a model less than its canonical window, set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` to see it (see [Debugging](#debugging)); a documented compatibility exception can then be added deliberately.

## Models

The picker is **discovered dynamically from OMP's Anthropic model catalogue** — there is no hard-coded discovery list to update when Anthropic ships a new revision. The bridge:

1. reads OMP's Anthropic catalogue at startup (synchronously, no network);
2. keeps entries from the validated Claude families — **fable**, **opus**, **sonnet**, **haiku** — at or above each family's validated baseline (Fable ≥ 5, Opus ≥ 4.6, Sonnet ≥ 4.6, Haiku ≥ 4.5), skipping dated snapshot ids;
3. orders each family newest-revision-first, so a partial name like `opus` always resolves to the newest Opus;
4. preserves the catalogue metadata — including each model's canonical `contextWindow` — and registers it directly, with no exact-id capability table.

When your installed OMP catalogue gains a new revision of a supported family (say Fable 5.2), it appears in `/model` automatically after restart with its catalogue context window — no bridge update needed. A completely new family is only added once it has been validated against the Claude Code runtime.

With the current OMP catalogue you get, e.g.:

| Picker id | Window |
| --------- | ------ |
| `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5-1` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-fable-5` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-5` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-7` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-6` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-4-6` | 1M |
| `claude-bridge/claude-haiku-4-5` | 200K (cheapest) |

Fable 5.1 requires Claude Code 2.1.251 or newer. If the Claude Code bundled with your installed Agent SDK is older, point `provider.pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` at a current stable CLI path such as `~/.local/bin/claude`.

Bash commands issued by Claude Code get a 120-second default timeout (matching Claude Code's default), since OMP's bash has no timeout by default.

## AskClaude tool

Available whenever the active provider is **not** claude-bridge. Your current model can hand work to Claude Code and wait for the result:

- "Ask Claude to plan a fix."
- "If you get stuck, ask Claude for help."
- "Ask Claude to review the plan in @foo.md, implement it, then ask an `isolated=true` Claude to review the implementation."
- "Ask Claude to poke holes in this theory."
- "Find all the places in the codebase that handle auth."

You can also bake it into a skill or AGENTS.md, e.g. *"Always call AskClaude to review complicated feature implementations before considering the task complete."*

### Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `prompt` | string | The question or task for Claude Code. |
| `mode` | `read` (default), `none`, `full` | `read` = read files + web; `full` = read/write/bash. Lock `full` out with `allowFullMode: false`. |
| `model` | `opus` (default), `sonnet`, `haiku`, or a full id | Which Claude model handles the delegation. |
| `thinking` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Effort level. |
| `isolated` | boolean (default `false`) | When `true`, Claude gets a clean session with no conversation history. |

## Configuration reference

Config is read from `~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.json` (global) and the project OMP config directory `.omp/claude-bridge.json` (project; merged over global). A starter file lives at [`claude-bridge.example.json`](claude-bridge.example.json).

```json
{
  "askClaude": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowFullMode": true,
    "defaultIsolated": false
  },
  "provider": {
    "strictMcpConfig": true
  }
}
```

**`askClaude`**

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Register the AskClaude tool. |
| `name` | `"AskClaude"` | Override the tool's OMP-side name. |
| `label` | `"Ask Claude Code"` | Override the TUI label. |
| `description` | — | Override the tool description shown to the model. |
| `defaultMode` | `"read"` | `read`, `none`, or `full`. |
| `defaultIsolated` | `false` | Start each call in a fresh session. |
| `allowFullMode` | `true` | Allow `mode: "full"`; set `false` to lock it out. |
| `appendSkills` | `true` | Forward OMP's skills block into the system prompt. |

**`provider`**

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | `true` | Project OMP's portable system-prompt additions (context files, skills, custom/append text, and subagent task context) behind Claude Code's preset. Set `false` to hand Claude Code only its own preset plus `settingSources`. |
| `settingSources` | — | Claude Code filesystem settings to load; only applied when `appendSystemPrompt: false`. |
| `strictMcpConfig` | `true` | Block MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` / `.mcp.json`. Cloud MCP is always blocked. |
| `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` | — | Path to the `claude` binary, if the bundled one is too old for a model or can't run on your OS/filesystem. Prefer a stable launcher/symlink path such as `~/.local/bin/claude`. |

## How it works

OMP's built-in tools are bridged to Claude Code and back, so from your side it behaves like any other OMP provider. Model discovery and context-window resolution live in [`src/models.ts`](src/models.ts), which is deliberately free of runtime imports so they stay unit-testable in isolation. On registration, the extension discovers bridge-compatible Claude models from OMP's Anthropic catalogue and registers each one with the catalogue's canonical `contextWindow` verbatim — there is no exact-id capability table to maintain. The Claude Agent SDK's runtime `supportedModels()` API is intentionally not part of initial registration — OMP needs the model list synchronously at startup, and that API carries no context-window metadata anyway — so the catalogue is the source of truth for capability.

### System-prompt transport

Claude Code always starts with its own native `claude_code` preset — the bridge never
replaces it with OMP's assembled system prompt. Instead it *projects* only the portable
parts of what OMP built onto Claude Code's preset via the preset's `append`:

- **project context files** (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) reach Claude Code once;
- **applicable skills** reach Claude Code once;
- **custom and append system-prompt text** reach Claude Code once;
- a **subagent's role/assignment block** — including native `task.context` (e.g. a
  sequential-decomposition child's `PRIOR_PHASE_RESULTS`) — reaches the child once.
  This is the class of content that used to disappear behind the bridge.

Why not just `append` OMP's whole assembled system prompt? Because that would duplicate
OMP's harness and tool catalog on top of Claude Code's own, recursively re-embed parent
prompts into child prompts, mix OMP-specific runtime instructions with Claude Code's
harness, and produce enormous prompts. Only the portable delta is projected.

OMP 18.2.2 exposes only the fully-assembled `systemPrompt` string array to extensions
(no structured breakdown), so the bridge records each assembled prompt at
`before_agent_start` keyed by the prompt itself ([`src/prompt-capture.ts`](src/prompt-capture.ts)).
Portable data is derived from the **rendered array itself**, not re-discovered from
`process.cwd()`: this preserves the exact context files OMP supplied to a subagent or
worktree, plus the default-layout append block and the rendered skills catalogue. When
OMP uses a custom system prompt, 18.2.2 no longer exposes the boundary between
`customPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt`; the bridge therefore preserves that combined
user/project block losslessly while removing generated project/skills containers and
re-projecting those once.

The provider then resolves its received prompt against those captures. Subagent prompt
**inheritance is projected rather than recursively copied**: when a prompt embeds a
previously-captured prompt, the raw parent is replaced by the parent's already-portable
projection, deduplicated, with cycle detection. The capture registry is process-global
(shared via `Symbol.for`, like provider-stream ownership) so a child session can record
under one extension instance while the parent-owned provider callback resolves it. The
registry is released only when that provider-owning instance shuts down; a child-session
shutdown cannot clear captures still needed by the parent.

If a received system prompt matches no capture and embeds no known capture, the bridge
**fails closed** with a diagnostic instead of quietly calling Claude Code with missing
instructions — a recoverable failed turn is better than silently losing the user's,
project's, or agent's instructions. Isolated flows that never pass through
`before_agent_start` (compaction/branch-summary) keep their own explicit prompts and are
not routed through this capture path. The AskClaude tool continues to forward the skills
block as before.

## Debugging

Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` for detailed logs:

- **Bridge log** — `~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.log`: every provider call, session-sync decision, tool-result delivery, and Claude Code stderr. Override the path with `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG_PATH`.
- **Reasoning-effort mapping** — provider and AskClaude calls emit a dedicated `reasoning-map` line with the registered/CLI model, the reasoning level requested by OMP, and the effort actually passed to the Claude Agent SDK. For example, `requestedReasoning=xhigh mappedEffort=xhigh`. Check it with `grep 'reasoning-map' ~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.log`.
- **Per-query CLI logs** — `~/.omp/agent/cc-cli-logs/<timestamp>-<tag>-<seq>.log`: the Claude Code subprocess's own debug stream, one file per query. Tags are `provider`, `continuation`, or `askclaude`.

When filing a session-resume bug (e.g. "No conversation found"), the `syncResult:` lines from the bridge log plus the matching `cc-cli-logs/` file are the most useful attachments.
