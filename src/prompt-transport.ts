/**
 * Resolve how one provider call should transport its system prompt to Claude Code.
 *
 * Normal OMP coding-agent turns always carry a cwd through agent-loop. A *fresh*
 * turn traverses before_agent_start immediately before its first provider call,
 * so its prompt is captured. Later calls in the same turn — the tool loop, and
 * OMP 18.2.8 automatic continuations such as the todo reminder's
 * `scheduleAgentContinue` → `agent.continue()` — reuse that same established
 * prompt without emitting before_agent_start again. They therefore still MUST
 * resolve through PromptCaptures, and a miss remains fail-closed: an
 * unaccountable prompt on a cwd-bearing call means the portable OMP material
 * would be silently dropped.
 *
 * Keeping the capture reachable for the whole life of a turn is the registry's
 * job, not this function's — see provider-registration.ts, where shared state
 * is released only once the last bound session shuts down.
 *
 * OMP also invokes providers directly through completeSimple() for utility/side
 * requests such as auto-thinking. Those calls do not traverse
 * before_agent_start, so no capture can exist by design. They normally have no
 * cwd; explicit agent-attributed side requests use initiatorOverride="agent".
 * For those calls the exact provider Context system prompt is already the
 * authoritative prompt, so send it verbatim instead of layering it onto the
 * claude_code coding-agent preset.
